      <p>In case you don't know Chaos Computer Congress is the biggest thing. It's THE THING. In fact there are two types of people in the world: those who are planning to go to CCC and those who haven't heard of it yet. That time of the year between Christmas and New Year (when most german cities turn into ghost towns) when a bunch of interesting folks hang out together, listen to each other and make stuff under umbrella of the shared ideals and love for technology. It is almost like Star Trek, but in a convention centre and only for four days. In fact CCC often... <a class="read-more" href="notes-from-33c3/">read more »</a>

      <p>It has been 2 weeks since the beginning of Outreachy and I've started working with people of Mozilla's WebExtensions. So far it was just awesomesause. So here is a story of how it came to be. What is Outreachy, anyway? Outreachy is a scholarship program for underrepresented groups (LGBTQ+ people, PoC and women) in open source software development. It is organised by nice people of GNOME Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy and Red Hat. Many-many cool companies support the program and work with the students. Why I've applied To be completely honest I feel very privileged to be part of Outreachy and in general. I am 'white... <a class="read-more" href="outreachy-week-1-2/">read more »</a>

      <p>Me and my lovely coning partner were lucky enough to get free tickets for this year Berlin BTconf. In fact we were so lucky that this is our 3rd conference this autumn. What is it? It is a general front-end/web/design conference. This particular instance had an absolute minimum of slides with code. Do with that information what you will. Some may not be happy about overall softness of talk and topics, but there are definitely ideas worth sharing and pondering on. Ever since ViewSource 2016, where people were friendly, talks were perspective changing, food and drinks were plentiful and delicious, and last week of... <a class="read-more" href="beyond-tellerland-berlin-2016/">read more »</a>

      <br><h2 class="list-headline"><a href="algorithms-pain-and-pleasure/">Algorithms: Pain and Pleasure</a></h2>
      <p>As soon as I became serious about not sucking as a programmer anymore, I developed some learning strategies. By developed I obviously mean lifted them from other people's good ideas and pretended they were mine all along. Great strategy. Highly recommend.  So I've been doing katas on codewars for a while. And since I've recently  discovered pleasures of JS I've been devoted to ranking up and finally feeling good about myself. Thats didn't last long. Pretty soon I hit the ceiling of my abilities. Bruised ego made me unhappy. Code wars is not perfect, it ranks katas in a very weird way, so someone like me... <a class="read-more" href="algorithms-pain-and-pleasure/">read more »</a>

      <p>So there was I sitting in the room full of developers, and the only person standing up was telling us how important it is to have presence online. "Bummer" - I though to myself, remembering how I last updated any of my social networks about 2 years ago. Then I remembered how one very helpful book recommended maintaining a blog to learn and get better. That sound helpful, I though to myself and went on instilling ghost. Here is my first post, which encapsulates a very postmodernist approach of writing about writing the first post. I hope to maintain this mischievous borgesian approach to the rest... <a class="read-more" href="lifelong-learning/">read more »</a>
